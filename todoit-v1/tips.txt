-- If you need to make performance improvements in your code, then you might want to consider using for..of loops, as they're converted to simple for loops, which have better performance compared to Array.forEach. However, take this advice with a grain of salt; it is true while we continue to target ES5, but runtime performance and TypeScript type inference both evolve over time.

-- Did you notice the '' !== newTodo.trim() check? Always put the safe part of the check on the left (that is, the two single quotes). In this case, the empty string, '', is safe, while calling trim() on newTodo could trigger an error (for example, if it was null). This is just one of many defensive programming tricks.


-- In VS Code, you can press Ctrl + Shift + M to show or hide the PROBLEMS view. It is very useful to quickly have an overview of all the issues in the project.


-- The main (unsafe) alternative to using filter is to use splice (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice) instead, but, as we mentioned, it really is unsafe. Basically, splice is also slower, creates garbage and is error-prone. More than enough reasons to simply forget about it!


-- Resume (F8): Let the program continue.
Step over next function call (F10): Continue the execution of the next function without going into it.
Step into next function call (F11): Continue the execution of the next function and go into it.
Step out of current function (Shift + F11): Get out of the current function.
Step (F9): Continue to the next statement.
