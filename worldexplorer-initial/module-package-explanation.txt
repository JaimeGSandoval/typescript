--  The controller package
Our controller interface is really straightforward. It exposes a set of methods that can be used in the HTML template to trigger operations:

  1. loadCountries will be invoked when the application starts. This method will retrieve the list of countries from the World Bank API using the population service. That list will then be displayed onscreen by the view layer.
  2. loadYears will also be called when the application starts. It will generate a list of years that the user can choose via select boxes. These will be used to define the range of data to fetch in order to create the charts (for example, 2000-2010).
  3. renderChart will gather the information needed to create a new chart and will then ask the view to render it onscreen.

 loadYears and loadCountries are both asynchronous.

 Our controller implementation will have a view at its disposal, as well as an instance of the population service to fetch the data.

 --  The view package
Our view interface (that is, WorldExplorerView) exposes only a few methods:

     1. displayCountries: Accepts an array of Country objects and displays them onscreen (in our case, simply within an HTML select element).
     2. displayYears: Displays a list of years in two HTML select elements: from and to.
     3. displayChart: Renders a chart onscreen, based on the chart description given as a ChartDetails  object.
     4. displayErrorMessage: Just like in the previous chapter, this method allows you to display an error message to the user.
     5 .getChartFormDetails: This method can be called by the controller to retrieve the contents of the form. That form will be used to configure the chart to generate.

The chart form will let the user select the following:
     1. The country to fetch data for
     2. The indicator (for example, total population, life expectancy, and so on)
     3. The start year
     4. The end year
     5. The type of chart to create (for example, line, bar, and so on)

When the user wants to render a new chart, a ChartDetails object will be created, containing everything required to render it:

     1. data: The data points
     2. dataLabel: The label for the data (this could be useful if we decide to display multiple datasets at once)
     3. title: The title of the chart
     4. xAxisLabel: The label for the x axis
     5. yAxisLabel: The label for the y axis
     6. chartType: The type of chart to render
