//  "lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"]
the values ES2020 and DOM tells typescript that we want to use features from the ES2020 ersion
of javascript. DOM is for using typing unique to the DOM

//  "strict": true
By setting strict to true you're turning on javascript strict mode which makes falsy and null checks a little bit easier to manage in typescript, amongst some other features
